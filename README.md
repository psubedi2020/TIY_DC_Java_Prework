# TIY_DC_Java_Prework

Working with Git will be a huge part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement almost anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to collaborate with other programmers.

### Tasks:

* [Create a Github account](https://github.com/signup)
* Read the class policies in the campus path
* [Edit your Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) to provide:
  * A picture, so I can recognize your face.
  * Your full name, so I can recognize your name.
  * A valid public email address, so I can contact you if I need to.
* [Complete the Code School course _Try Git_](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
  * Take a [screenshot](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) of the Try Git course when you complete it and add it to the hello world repo you will create in the next step.
* [Complete the "Hello World" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * Submit a link to the repo you just made below in the submission form for this assignment.
